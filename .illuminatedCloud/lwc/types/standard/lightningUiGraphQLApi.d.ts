Parse the query using the gql JavaScript template literal function. gql parses the GraphQL query into a format that the wire adapter can use. gql isn't reactive. If you include ${} string interpolation constructs, they're evaluated one time only when the template literal is expanded.
     * @param variables A key-value pair of dynamic values for the gql query. Use variables with a getter function so the wire adapter can react to changes.
     * @param operationName The name of the operation that you want to perform in the query. For improved debugging on the server-side that easily identifies different GraphQL requests, we recommend labeling your queries with query operationName instead of using the shorthand syntax query. For example, query bigAccounts or query serviceReports.

The actual value to which the Promise resolves is meaningless.
